## Overview

This repository serves as a sandbox for experimenting with programming concepts and tools. It is designed to:

* Prototype new ideas and projects
* Learn and document programming concepts
* Explore system-level programming and Linux development

## Project Structure

* `CPP/` – C++ experiments and projects
* `designpatterns/` – designpatterns experiments and projects
* `linux/` – linux experiments and projects
* `iot-hub/` – mini project for LIN protocol based IOT hub
* `LinuxDeviceDriver/` – Linux device driver development experiments
