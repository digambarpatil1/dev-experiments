## Overview

This repository serves as a sandbox for experimenting with programming concepts and tools. It is designed to:

* Prototype new ideas and projects
* Learn and document programming concepts
* Explore system-level programming and Linux development

## Project Structure

* `CPP/` – C++ experiments and projects
* `Cmake/` – CMake configuration examples
* `IPC/` – Inter-process communication experiments
* `LinuxDeviceDriver/` – Linux device driver development experiments

Each folder may contain its own README with detailed instructions and examples.

## Technologies Used

* **C++** – System-level programming and performance-critical projects
* **CMake** – Build automation and project configuration
* **Bash** – Automation and scripting
* **Linux Kernel** – Low-level system programming and device drivers
